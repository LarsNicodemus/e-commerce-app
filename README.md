# E-Commerce App

This project is an e-commerce app developed as part of the iOS module at the Syntax Institute. It is a solo project designed to teach and practice key software architecture concepts and patterns, including **Repository Pattern**, **ObservedObject**, **EnvironmentObject**, and **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**. The app simulates a simple online store where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and manage their orders.

## About the App

The E-Commerce App is a demonstration of how to structure an iOS application using modern architectural patterns. It allows users to explore a catalog of products, view product details, add items to a shopping cart, and simulate a checkout process. The app emphasizes clean code, separation of concerns, and efficient state management.

## Features

- **Product Catalog**: Browse a list of products with details such as name, price, and image.
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about a selected product.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add and remove products from a shopping cart.
- **Checkout Simulation**: Simulate a checkout process with a summary of the order.
- **State Management**: Use `ObservedObject` and `EnvironmentObject` to manage app state efficiently.

## Technologies and Concepts

- **Repository Pattern**: Centralize data access logic to improve testability and maintainability.
- **ObservedObject**: Bind views to observable data models for real-time updates.
- **EnvironmentObject**: Share data across multiple views without explicit passing.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separate the app into **Model**, **View**, and **ViewModel** layers for better organization and scalability.
- **SwiftUI**: Build the user interface using Swift's declarative framework.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
